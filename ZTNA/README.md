## Description

Deploy a single BYOL FortiGate in AWS using CloudFormation with preconfigured ZTNA settings

## Deployment overview

This deployment requires that you already have the following already configured:

-   A VPC
-   Two subnets - **Public and Private Subnets**
-   A existing Web Server inside the private subnet.  Used for testing ZTNA application access.
-   S3 bucket in the same region where the CloudFormation template will deploy in.


### Cloudformation deploys the following components:

-   A FortiGate BYOL instance with two NICs, one in each subnet
-   An S3 endpoint inside the public subnet. (Depends on if already existed)
    <sub>S3 endpoint is used for connecting to the S3 bucket via internally.
-   A Lambda function.
