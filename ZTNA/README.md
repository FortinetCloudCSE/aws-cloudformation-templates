## Description

Deploy a single BYOL FortiGate in AWS using CloudFormation with preconfigured ZTNA settings

## Deployment overview

This deployment requires that you already have the following already configured:

-   A VPC
-   Two subnets - **Public and Private Subnets**
-   A existing Web Server inside the private subnet.  Used for testing ZTNA application access.
-   S3 bucket in the same region where the CloudFormation template will deploy in.


### Cloudformation deploys the following components:

-   A FortiGate BYOL instance with two NICs, one in each subnet
-   An S3 endpoint inside the public subnet. (Depends on if already existed)
    <sub>S3 endpoint is used for connecting to the S3 bucket via internally.
-   A Lambda function.

## Deployment:

1. Fill in the parameters as shown below:

-   CIDRForInstanceAccess : CIDR Range to allow access. 0.0.0.0/0 to allow all.
-   EncryptVolumes : To encrypt the instances OS and log volumes disk
-   FortiOSVersion: FOS Version
-   InitS3Bucket: S3 Bucket name where the config files, and license file is stored.  The bucket should exist in the same region as this deployment for succesful bootstrapping.
-   InstanceType: Instace type for the ZTNA Gateway instance
-   KeyPair: Select a SSH keypair to associate with the ZTNA Gateway
-   LicenseType: License Type for the ZTNA Gateway
-   LocalUsername: The name of the localuser used for authentication when accessing ZTNA Application
-   LocalUserPassword: The pasword of the localuser used for authentication when accessing ZTNA Application
-   PrivateSubnet: Select the existing subnet for PrivateSubnet
-   PrivateSubnetRouterIP: Provide the IP address of the AWS intrinsic router (First IP from PrivateSubnet)
-   PublicSubnet: Select the existing subnet for PublicSubnet
-   PublicSubnetRouterIP: Provide the IP address of the AWS intrinsic router (First IP from PublicSubnet)
-   PublicSubnetRouteTableID: If a new S3 Endpoint is to be deployed, provide the route table ID associated to PublicSubnet
-   S3EndpointDeployment: Select if a new S3 Endpoint should be deployed or not.  Default is UseExisting.
-   ServerName: Provide the name for the Application Server.
-   ServerPrivateIP: Provide the Private IP address in CIDR form for the private interface of Application Server (IP from PrivateSubnet)
-   VPCCIDR: Provide a network CIDR for the VPC.
-   VPCID: Select the existing VPC to use.
-   ZTNAGatewayLicenseFile: Provide the name of the BYOL license file in the Init S3 Bucket for ZTNA Gateway (ie fgt.lic or prefix/fgt.lic)
-   ZTNAGatewayPrivateIP: Provide the IP address in CIDR form for the private interface of ZTNA Gateway (IP from PrivateSubnet)
-   ZTNAGatewayPublicIP: Provide the IP address in CIDR form for the public interface of ZTNA Gateway (IP from PublicSubnet)
-   EMSServerType: Select the EMS Server type for the ZTNA Gateway.  Default is Cloud.
-   EMSServerIP: If OnPremise from EMSServerType is choosen, then needs to provide the IP address in CIDR form for the EMS Server's Public IP accessible.
-   EMSServerPort: If OnPremise from EMSServerType is choosen, then needs to provide the Port to connect to the EMS Server Public IP.
